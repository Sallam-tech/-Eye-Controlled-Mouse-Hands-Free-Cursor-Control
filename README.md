# -Eye-Controlled-Mouse-Hands-Free-Cursor-Control
👁️ Eye-Controlled Mouse – Hands-Free Cursor Control
Control your computer with just your eyes — no hands required. This intelligent, accessibility-focused project lets users move the cursor and perform mouse clicks using eye movement and blinks, built entirely in Python,
his AI-powered solution makes computer interaction more accessible for everyone, especially users with physical disabilities.

🚀 Features
🎯 Real-time eye tracking with MediaPipe

👁️ Cursor follows your gaze smoothly

👋 Blink-based mouse actions:

Left Eye Blink → Left Click

Right Eye Blink → Right Click

Both Eyes Blink → Double Click

🧠 Why This Was Built
This project explores how AI and Computer Vision can improve accessibility for individuals with limited mobility. It was designed during my summer research to push boundaries in hands-free interaction.

"Tech should empower everyone — and this project is a step toward that vision."
